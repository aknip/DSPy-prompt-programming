They built Moonsift with the vision of using AI to help shoppers more easily discover products. They have been collecting product data from retailers and cross-retailer shopping data through their browser extension, which has allowed them to train machine learning models on over 60M products, 250M interactions, and 40K retailers. With this data, Moonsift is now ready to launch their AI Copilot, a system designed to understand user intent and serve intelligent results, thereby enhancing the online shopping experience.\n",

      "Blog: \"Understanding Weaviate's Hybrid Search: Functioning, Fusion Algorithms, and Result Combination\" Hybrid search is a powerful technique that enhances the accuracy and relevance of search results by merging the best features of keyword-based search algorithms and vector search techniques. This method is employed in Weaviate, a platform that introduced this feature in its 1.17 version. Hybrid search uses both dense and sparse vectors to represent the meaning and context of search queries and documents. Dense vectors excel at understanding the context of the query, while sparse vectors are adept at keyword matches. This combination allows for more accurate and contextually relevant search results. Weaviate offers two fusion algorithms for hybrid search: `rankedFusion` and `relativeScoreFusion`. The `rankedFusion` algorithm is the default, but the newer `relativeScoreFusion` is considered a better choice for most users. These algorithms work by preparing the scores from each search to be compatible with each other, allowing them to be weighted, added up, and presented to the user. In essence, hybrid search in Weaviate combines the strengths of vector and keyword search to deliver semantically rich and precise results. It merges the contextual semantics from the vector search with the keyword matching from the BM25 scoring, producing a set of candidate results. The ranking model then takes the query and candidate document pair as input, further reasoning about the relevance of these results without the need for specialized training. This method of combining results in hybrid search provides a more effective and efficient search experience for users.\n",

      " A self-driving database, such as a vector database, is a revolutionary technology that uses machine learning models to index data. This type of database excels at extracting value from unstructured data, including text, photos, video, audio files, and even genetic information. It can answer queries posed in natural language and search anything from images to DNA. Much of the software involved in these databases is open source, allowing users to customize it to meet their specific needs. This AI-first database technology is ushering in a new era of data management and retrieval. The evolution of database technology has seen three major waves. The first wave was dominated by SQL databases, managed by companies like Oracle and Microsoft. The second wave, known as NoSQL, marked a shift from relational tables to different data storage methods. The third and current wave is characterized by AI-first databases, such as Weaviate's vector database. These databases process data using machine learning models, enabling them to handle a wide range of data types and queries. Key features of a self-driving database include consistency, resiliency, and scaling. One of the unique aspects of a self-driving database is its ability to answer queries posed in natural language, extending beyond text searches to include searches for images, DNA, and more. A self-driving database like Weaviate offers several benefits. It uses AI models to process, store, and search through data, making it excellent at answering questions in natural language and adaptable to searching images or genetic information. Unlike a traditional relational database that is designed to store structured data in columns, a vector database like Weaviate is optimized to store unstructured data and their vector embeddings. This difference in optimization leads to a difference in the way data is stored and retrieved. The future of database management is being shaped by the emergence of AI-first database technology and vector databases. This \"third wave\" of database technology includes new search engines and databases that can answer queries posed in natural language and search anything from images to DNA. As a result, Weaviate excels at answering questions in natural language and is adaptable to searching images or even genetic information.\n"

Some databases scale really well in the cloud, others work best as big, single machines. The exact characteristics do not make a database a database. But the fact that the engineers who built it have decided on a specific strategy is a key trait of a database.What I love about all this work, like self-ask, chain of thought, we're developing new querying languages. This is like us inventing SQL, except that we didn't design the database. The database came into being and we have to figure out how to interact with it. That example I mentioned about the IPython interaction, like that's a, again, it's a new querying language. And I honestly thought the most potent part of the self-ask wasn't even necessarily the self-ask part.## How We Got Here First-wave database technology is often called by the acronym SQL—the initials of a ubiquitous query language used to manage relational databases, which are conceptually similar to spreadsheets or tables. Throughout the 1980s, this technology was dominated by companies like Oracle and Microsoft. The second wave of databases is called \"NoSQL\". These are the domain of companies like MongoDB. They store data in different ways, for example, key-value stores, document stores, wide-column stores and graph databases, but what they all have in common is that they're not relational tables.### The appeal of Weakly-Suppervised or Self-Supervised learning techniques The list of datasets from the 1B training pairs challenge illustrates the appeal of Weakly Supervised or Self-Supervised Learning techniques. To contrast, Natural Questions is one of the larger Supervised datasets for the Question Answering Task. Natural Questions (NQ) requires humans to derive questions given a Wikipedia context as input. As a result of this slow process, the dataset contains 100,231 question-context-answer tuples… Which is quite impressive, but much smaller than the ~730 million pairs extracted from Reddit without human intervention. ### Scale vs model fit Large-scale and **expensive** models can achieve remarkable abilities with datasets like 730 million Reddit conversations.--- title: The AI-First Database Ecosystem slug: the-ai-first-database-ecosystem authors: [bob] date: 2022-06-23 tags: ['concepts'] image: ./img/hero.jpeg # canonical-url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/06/23/the-ai-first-database-ecosystem/ # canonical-name: Forbes description: \"Learn about the vision of the AI-First Database Ecosystem, which drives the R&D of the databases of the future.\" --- ![The AI-First Database Ecosystem](./img/hero.jpeg) <!-- truncate --> A new ecosystem of smaller companies is ushering in a \"third wave\" of AI-first database technology.

But earlier this year, we saw a shift in usage patterns: As we onboarded more and more large-scale and enterprise users, the definition of scale shifted from the number of vectors to the number of individual tenants that can run on a single setup. Previously, Weaviate offered multiple ways to tackle multi-tenancy, but none were intended for a massive scale.\n",

We can start by defining multi-tenancy as the need to serve multiple distinct users or user groups from a single application. Then, we can explain how it is implemented in Weaviate, where users can select multi-tenancy for their classes and specify a tenant key for every operation. We can also mention that Weaviate's multi-tenancy feature is opt-in and is designed to be cost-efficient and capable of handling tenants of vastly different sizes. Lastly, we can highlight that Weaviate's upcoming release will offer native multi-tenancy support that scales to millions of tenants.\n",

New search engines and databases brilliantly answer queries posed in natural language, but their machine-learning models are not limited to text searches. The same approach can also be used to search anything from images to DNA. Much of the software involved is open source, so it functions transparently and users can customize it to meet their specific needs. Clients can retain control of their data, keeping it safely behind their own firewalls.### Vector Database vs. Traditional (Relational) Database The main difference between a traditional (relational) database and a modern vector database comes from the type of data they were optimized for. While a relational database is designed to store structured data in columns, a vector database is also optimized to store unstructured data (e.g., text, images, or audio) and their vector embeddings. Because vector databases and relational databases are optimized for different types of data, they also differ in the way data is stored and retrieved. In a relational database, data is stored in columns and retrieved by keyword matches in traditional search.* **Consistency. Resiliency and Scaling** Some databases have atomic transactions, others don't support consistency at all. Some databases scale really well in the cloud, others work best as big, single machines. The exact characteristics do not make a database a database. But the fact that the engineers who built it have decided on a specific strategy is a key trait of a database.This leads to the simplest definition of a third database wave: A vector database that stores data indexed by machine learning models. Different types of databases (e.g., vector search engines) allow users to search through these vectorized datasets, and others (e.g., feature stores) allow users to store vectors at a large scale for later use. ## We're awash in unstructured data. We're living in a time of massive data accumulation and much, if not most of it, is unstructured: text, photos, video, audio files, as well as other things such as genetic information. Vector search is particularly good at extracting value from such data.However, consistent with Weaviate's commitment to creating truly open-source software, customers using the free service will always be able to access all of the Weaviate's vector database capabilities. Weaviate vector database is an example of a \"third wave\" database technology. Data is processed by a machine learning model first, and AI models help in processing, storing, and searching through the data. As a result, Weaviate excels at answering questions in natural language, but it is not limited to language; it is as adaptable to searching images or even genetic information. > \"Depending on the machine-learning model used, a \"document\"—basically a data object—in a vector database typically has anywhere from 120 to 12,800 dimensions,\" van Luijt explains.\n",

      "Blog Post: Multi-tenancy is defined as the need to serve multiple distinct users or user groups from a single application. In the context of Weaviate, a user can select multi-tenancy for their classes and specify a tenant key for every operation. This feature is opt-in, meaning if you don't require it, there are no changes for you. It is designed to be cost-efficient and capable of handling tenants of vastly different sizes. The upcoming release of Weaviate, version 1.20, will offer native multi-tenancy support that scales to millions of tenants, with tens of thousands of active tenants per node. This new feature is not just an additional feature, but a rethinking of how businesses with many customers can scale with Weaviate. Multi-tenancy is a crucial feature in modern software applications due to its numerous benefits. It allows serving multiple distinct users or user groups from a single application, which enhances efficiency and resource utilization. One of the key advantages of multi-tenancy is cost-efficiency, as it allows for optimal resource usage, especially in scenarios where usage peaks at certain times but remains idle for the rest of the time. It also supports a diverse range of tenants, from small to large, catering to their varying needs effectively. Multi-tenancy also ensures speed, as narrowing a request down to a single tenant does not require much computational effort. It facilitates easy onboarding and offboarding of tenants without affecting the performance of the system for other tenants. Moreover, it sets resource boundaries to prevent interference between different tenants' operations. Therefore, multi-tenancy is not just an additional feature, but a fundamental rethinking of how a business scales with its customers. The upcoming Weaviate v1.20 release, set for July 2023, introduces a game-changing feature: native multi-tenancy support. Multi-tenancy, defined as the ability to serve multiple distinct users or user groups from a single application, is a crucial aspect of modern software architecture. The new multi-tenancy feature in Weaviate is designed to scale to millions of tenants, with the capacity to support over 50,000 active tenants per node. This scalability is complemented by an emphasis on compliance, with features such as GDPR-compliant deletes, and a smooth user experience. If the need arises to onboard more tenants, users can simply add a new node to their existing cluster. This is a significant upgrade from previous versions of Weaviate, which required workarounds to model a multi-tenancy landscape. With the new native multi-tenancy support, Weaviate is rethinking how businesses can scale with their many customers. Multi-tenancy offers numerous benefits for businesses, particularly in terms of scalability and efficiency. One of the primary advantages is its ease of use; businesses can simply select multi-tenancy for their classes and continue using their favorite features such as super-fast queries, cross-references, and replication. Multi-tenancy also provides cost-efficiency, especially for businesses with usage peaks at certain times but remain inactive for many days of the month. This feature allows for the diversity of tenants, accommodating both large and small customers. Speed is another benefit, as narrowing a request down to a single tenant does not require much work, even with millions of tenants. Onboarding and offboarding are also made easy with multi-tenancy, ensuring that adding or removing a business does not impose a significant computational load. Furthermore, multi-tenancy ensures resource boundaries, preventing the activities of one tenant from interfering with others. In the latest version of Weaviate, multi-tenancy is an opt-in feature, allowing businesses to serve multiple distinct users or user groups from a single application. Weaviate v1.20, set to be released in July 2023, is introducing a native multi-tenancy feature that can serve multiple distinct users or user groups from a single application. This feature is designed to scale to millions of tenants, with the capacity to support tens of thousands of active tenants per node. In addition to scalability, the new multi-tenancy feature also emphasizes compliance and user experience, offering functionalities such as GDPR-compliant deletes. The multi-tenancy feature is opt-in, so users who don't require it won't be affected. Designed to scale with your business, it can support over 50,000 active tenants per node. If you run out of space but want to onboard more tenants, you can simply add a new node to your existing cluster. The Weaviate team is excited about this upcoming release and welcomes feedback from users.\n",

This type of database is particularly adept at extracting value from unstructured data, which includes text, photos, video, audio files, and other forms of data such as genetic information. Self-driving databases can brilliantly answer queries posed in natural language and can be used to search anything from images to DNA. Much of the software involved in these databases is open source, which means it functions transparently and users can customize it to meet their specific needs. This new wave of AI-first database technology is ushering in a new era of data management and retrieval. The evolution of database technology has seen three major waves. The first wave was dominated by SQL databases, which are conceptually similar to spreadsheets or tables and were managed by companies like Oracle and Microsoft. The second wave, known as NoSQL, marked a shift from relational tables to different data storage methods, including key-value stores, document stores, wide-column stores, and graph databases. The third and current wave is characterized by AI-first databases, such as Weaviate's vector database. These databases process data using machine learning models, enabling them to answer questions in natural language and search through various types of data, including text, images, and even genetic information.

You can keep using all your favorite features, including super-fast queries, cross-references, and replication. The only change? For every operation, specify the tenant key – a user-defined property in your schema. That’s all that changes.Weaviate `v1.20` - coming in July 2023 - changes this once and for all: Native multi-tenancy support that scales to millions of tenants with 10s of thousands of active tenants per node. Yet scale is not the only point that makes the new multi-tenancy feature great; we put a lot of emphasis on compliance and a smooth UX. GDPR-compliant deletes with one command are just one of the many features. Let me walk you through what’s coming in the next Weaviate release and show you why I’m incredibly excited about this one. ## The need for multi-tenancy We define multi-tenancy as the need to serve multiple distinct users or user groups from a single application.## No more workarounds: Native multi-tenancy support for the largest of cases ![multi-tenancy](./img/multi-tenancy-dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only) ![multi-tenancy](./img/multi-tenancy-light.png#gh-light-mode-only) Let me walk you through the best parts of the native multi-tenancy feature in Weaviate `v1.20` and even some of the plans that we have for upcoming releases. As you will see, Multi-Tenancy is not just an additional feature. It is rethinking from the ground up how your business, with its many customers, scales with Weaviate. ### Ease of use of your favorite Weaviate features Weaviate’s new multi-tenancy mode is opt-in. If you don’t require it, there are no changes for you.* **Cost-efficiency**: With usage peaking around tax season but most tenants inactive for many days of the month, ACME shouldn’t have to pay for a large setup that is essentially idle most of the time. * **Diversity of tenants**: ACME has both large and small customers. Their setup needs to be able to handle tenants of vastly different sizes. While most tenants are small, a few tenants can make up a large bulk of the data. ## A time before multi-tenancy support Before Weaviate `v1.20`, you had two options to model a multi-tenancy landscape.--- title: Multi-Tenancy Vector Search with millions of tenants slug: multi-tenancy-vector-search authors: [etienne] date: 2023-06-15 image: ./img/hero.png tags: ['engineering', 'concepts'] description: \"Learn about the new native multi-tenancy feature\" --- ![Multi-Tenancy ](./img/hero.png) <!-- truncate --> Large-scale setups were always a great reason to choose Weaviate.

      "Contexts: Then we will dive into the technical details of how distance metrics are used in vector search and how vector indexes enable efficient retrieval. Once we have a fundamental understanding of vector databases, we will discuss their use cases and the current tool landscape. ## What is a Vector Database? A vector database indexes, stores, and provides access to structured or unstructured data (e.g., text or images) alongside its vector embeddings, which are the data's numerical representation. It allows users to find and retrieve similar objects quickly at scale in production.### Vector Database vs. Traditional (Relational) Database The main difference between a traditional (relational) database and a modern vector database comes from the type of data they were optimized for. While a relational database is designed to store structured data in columns, a vector database is also optimized to store unstructured data (e.g., text, images, or audio) and their vector embeddings. Because vector databases and relational databases are optimized for different types of data, they also differ in the way data is stored and retrieved. In a relational database, data is stored in columns and retrieved by keyword matches in traditional search.Check out one of our free weekly workshops to help you understand what vector databases are and how they can help you build production-ready AI apps quickly and easily. If you’re curious, here are some of the most commonly asked questions we encountered: **What’s the difference between a vector database and a graph or relational database?** Graph databases are used to identify relationships between objects, and vector databases are used to find objects Relational databases store the relations between tables and build indexes for the fast lookup of joined tables. Vector databases, on the other hand, store the embeddings of structured and unstructured data for the quick retrieval of the objects. **What features does Weaviate offer to help me protect data privacy?** Weaviate is designed with robust security measures to ensure it meets the requirements of enterprise environments. Weaviate has achieved SOC 2 certification and is encrypted in transit and at rest.Because a vector database can help find similar objects, it is predestined for applications where you might want to find similar products, movies, books, songs, etc. That’s why vector databases are also **used in recommendation systems in classical ML applications** as a restated task of search. With the rise of LLMs, **vector databases have already been used to enhance modern LLM applications**. You might have already come across the term that vector databases provide LLMs with long-term memory. LLMs are stateless, which means that they immediately forget what you have just discussed if you don’t store this information in, e.g., a vector database and thus provide them with a state.![vector-database-definition.png](img/vector-database-definition.png) This section introduces the core concepts of vector databases. We will discuss what vector embeddings are, how they enable similarity search, and how they accelerate it. ### Vector Embeddings When you think of data, you probably think of neatly organized numbers in spreadsheets. This type of data is called structured data because it can easily be stored in tabular format. But roughly 80% of today’s data is said to be unstructured.\n",

      "Contexts: This leads to the simplest definition of a third database wave: A vector database that stores data indexed by machine learning models. Different types of databases (e.g., vector search engines) allow users to search through these vectorized datasets, and others (e.g., feature stores) allow users to store vectors at a large scale for later use. ## We're awash in unstructured data. We're living in a time of massive data accumulation and much, if not most of it, is unstructured: text, photos, video, audio files, as well as other things such as genetic information. Vector search is particularly good at extracting value from such data.### Vector Database vs. Traditional (Relational) Database The main difference between a traditional (relational) database and a modern vector database comes from the type of data they were optimized for. While a relational database is designed to store structured data in columns, a vector database is also optimized to store unstructured data (e.g., text, images, or audio) and their vector embeddings. Because vector databases and relational databases are optimized for different types of data, they also differ in the way data is stored and retrieved. In a relational database, data is stored in columns and retrieved by keyword matches in traditional search.Then we will dive into the technical details of how distance metrics are used in vector search and how vector indexes enable efficient retrieval. Once we have a fundamental understanding of vector databases, we will discuss their use cases and the current tool landscape. ## What is a Vector Database?

Because vector databases and relational databases are optimized for different types of data, they also differ in the way data is stored and retrieved. In a relational database, data is stored in columns and retrieved by keyword matches in traditional search.vector search](img/Traditional_Search_X_Vector_Search.jpg) Because most vector databases do not only store vector embeddings but store them together with the original source data, they are not only capable of vector search but also enable traditional keyword search. Some vector databases like [Weaviate](http://weaviate.io) even support hybrid search capabilities which combine vector search with keyword search. ### Vector Database vs. Vector-Capable Database (SQL and NoSQL) Today many existing databases have already enabled vector support and vector search. However, they usually don’t index the vector embeddings, which makes the vector search slow.In contrast, vector databases also store the vector embeddings of the original data, which enables efficient semantic search. For example, imagine you have a database that stores Jeopardy questions, and you want to retrieve all questions that contain an animal. Because traditional search relies on keyword matches, you would have to create a big query that queries all animals (e.g., contains \"dog\", or contains \"cat\", or contains \"wolf\", etc.). With semantic search, you could simply query for the concept of \"animals\". ![Traditional search vs.Thus, an advantage of AI-native vector databases over vector-capable databases is their efficiency in vector search due to vector indexing. ### Vector Database vs. Vector Indexing Library Similarly to vector databases, [vector libraries](https://weaviate.io/blog/vector-library-vs-vector-database) also enable fast vector search. However, vector libraries only store vector embeddings of data objects, and they store them in in-memory indexes. This results in two key differences: 1.Check out one of our free weekly workshops to help you understand what vector databases are and how they can help you build production-ready AI apps quickly and easily.

Although vector databases have been around for a few years, they’ve just recently drawn the wider developer community’s attention. The excitement around vector databases is closely related to the release of ChatGPT. Since late 2022, the public has started to understand the capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), while developers have realized that vector databases can enhance these models further. This article will walk through what vector databases are and explain some of their core concepts, such as vector embeddings and vector search.\n",

      "Contexts: But if you have a multi-tenancy case, all you need to do is select multi-tenancy for your class (or classes). You can keep using all your favorite features, including super-fast queries, cross-references, and replication. The only change? For every operation, specify the tenant key – a user-defined property in your schema. That’s all that changes.Weaviate `v1.20` - coming in July 2023 - changes this once and for all: Native multi-tenancy support that scales to millions of tenants with 10s of thousands of active tenants per node. Yet scale is not the only point that makes the new multi-tenancy feature great; we put a lot of emphasis on compliance and a smooth UX. GDPR-compliant deletes with one command are just one of the many features. Let me walk you through what’s coming in the next Weaviate release and show you why I’m incredibly excited about this one. ## The need for multi-tenancy We define multi-tenancy as the need to serve multiple distinct users or user groups from a single application.## No more workarounds: Native multi-tenancy support for the largest of cases ![multi-tenancy](./img/multi-tenancy-dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only) ![multi-tenancy](./img/multi-tenancy-light.png#gh-light-mode-only) Let me walk you through the best parts of the native multi-tenancy feature in Weaviate `v1.20` and even some of the plans that we have for upcoming releases. As you will see, Multi-Tenancy is not just an additional feature. It is rethinking from the ground up how your business, with its many customers, scales with Weaviate. ### Ease of use of your favorite Weaviate features Weaviate’s new multi-tenancy mode is opt-in. If you don’t require it, there are no changes for you.* **Cost-efficiency**: With usage peaking around tax season but most tenants inactive for many days of the month, ACME shouldn’t have to pay for a large setup that is essentially idle most of the time. * **Diversity of tenants**: ACME has both large and small customers. Their setup needs to be able to handle tenants of vastly different sizes. While most tenants are small, a few tenants can make up a large bulk of the data. ## A time before multi-tenancy support Before Weaviate `v1.20`, you had two options to model a multi-tenancy landscape.--- title: Multi-Tenancy Vector Search with millions of tenants slug: multi-tenancy-vector-search authors: [etienne] date: 2023-06-15 image: ./img/hero.png tags: ['engineering', 'concepts'] description: \"Learn about the new native multi-tenancy feature\" --- ![Multi-Tenancy ](./img/hero.png) <!-- truncate --> Large-scale setups were always a great reason to choose Weaviate. Last year we wrote about the first time [a Weaviate setup ran with a billion objects & vectors](/blog/sphere-dataset-in-weaviate). What was a mere experiment back then is a regular production case today. But earlier this year, we saw a shift in usage patterns: As we onboarded more and more large-scale and enterprise users, the definition of scale shifted from the number of vectors to the number of individual tenants that can run on a single setup. Previously, Weaviate offered multiple ways to tackle multi-tenancy, but none were intended for a massive scale.\n",

      "Contexts: ### Example Use Cases Vector libraries are commonly used for applications that do not have changing data. For example, academic information retrieval benchmarks are designed to test performance on a **static snapshot** of data. When plugging an ANN index into production-ready applications, databases offer many appealing features not found in a library. <img src={require('./img/vector-library-vs-database.png').default} alt=\"alt\" style={{ maxWidth: \"75%\" }} /> ## Vector Databases One of the core features that set vector databases apart from libraries is the ability to store and update your data. Vector databases have full **CRUD** (create, read, update, and delete) support that solves the limitations of a vector library.Then we will dive into the technical details of how distance metrics are used in vector search and how vector indexes enable efficient retrieval. Once we have a fundamental understanding of vector databases, we will discuss their use cases and the current tool landscape. ## What is a Vector Database? A vector database indexes, stores, and provides access to structured or unstructured data (e.g., text or images) alongside its vector embeddings, which are the data's numerical representation. It allows users to find and retrieve similar objects quickly at scale in production.This enables LLMs to hold an actual conversation. Also, you can store the domain-specific context in a vector database to minimize the LLM from hallucinating. Other popular examples of vector databases improving the capabilities of LLMs are question-answering and retrieval-augmented generation. Here is an example [demo](https://github.com/weaviate/healthsearch-demo) called [HealthSearch](https://weaviate.io/blog/healthsearch-demo) of a [Weaviate](http://weaviate.io) vector database in action together with an LLM showcasing the potential of leveraging user-written reviews and queries to retrieve supplement products based on specific health effects. ![example-use-case-llm-vector-database](../2023-07-26-healthsearch-blogpost/img/hero.png) ## Tool Landscape around Vector Databases Although vector databases are AI-native and specifically designed to handle vector embeddings and enable efficient vector search, alternatives like [vector libraries](https://weaviate.io/blog/vector-library-vs-vector-database) and vector-capable databases exist as well.Because a vector database can help find similar objects, it is predestined for applications where you might want to find similar products, movies, books, songs, etc. That’s why vector databases are also **used in recommendation systems in classical ML applications** as a restated task of search. With the rise of LLMs, **vector databases have already been used to enhance modern LLM applications**. You might have already come across the term that vector databases provide LLMs with long-term memory. LLMs are stateless, which means that they immediately forget what you have just discussed if you don’t store this information in, e.g., a vector database and thus provide them with a state.Then the algorithm would also prevent you from venturing further from relevant results, as the objects are pre-organized by similarity. ![Vector indexing for Approximate Nearest Neighbor](img/vector-indexing.jpg) The above example roughly describes the concept of the [Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09320) algorithm, which is the default ANN algorithm in [Weaviate](http://weaviate.io). However, there are several ANN algorithms to index the vectors, which can be categorized into the following groups: - **Clustering**-based index (e.g., [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)) - **Proximity graph**-based index (e.g., [HNSW](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09320)) - **Tree**-based index (e.g., [ANNOY](https://github.com/spotify/annoy)) - **Hash**-based index (e.g., [LSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing)) - **Compression**-based index (e.g., [PQ](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5432202) or [SCANN](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/07/announcing-scann-efficient-vector.html)) Note that indexing enables fast retrieval at query time, but it can take a lot of time to build the index initially. Further reading [Why Is Vector Search So Fast?](https://weaviate.io/blog/why-is-vector-search-so-fast) ## Use Cases of Vector Databases Vector databases’ search capabilities can be used in various applications ranging from classical ML use cases, such as recommender systems, to providing long-term memory to large language models in modern applications. The **most popular use case of vector databases is for search**.\n",
