This feature is opt-in, meaning if you don't require it, there are no changes for you. It is designed to be cost-efficient and capable of handling tenants of vastly different sizes. The upcoming release of Weaviate, version 1.20, will offer native multi-tenancy support that scales to millions of tenants, with tens of thousands of active tenants per node. This new feature is not just an additional feature, but a rethinking of how businesses with many customers can scale with Weaviate.\n \nMulti-tenancy is a crucial feature in modern software applications due to its numerous benefits. It allows serving multiple distinct users or user groups from a single application, which enhances efficiency and resource utilization. One of the key advantages of multi-tenancy is cost-efficiency, as it allows for optimal resource usage, especially in scenarios where usage peaks at certain times but remains idle for the rest of the time. It also supports a diverse range of tenants, from small to large, catering to their varying needs effectively. Multi-tenancy also ensures speed, as narrowing a request down to a single tenant does not require much computational effort. It facilitates easy onboarding and offboarding of tenants without affecting the performance of the system for other tenants. Moreover, it sets resource boundaries to prevent interference between different tenants' operations. Therefore, multi-tenancy is not just an additional feature, but a fundamental rethinking of how a business scales with its customers.\n \nThe upcoming Weaviate v1.20 release, set for July 2023, introduces a game-changing feature: native multi-tenancy support. Multi-tenancy, defined as the ability to serve multiple distinct users or user groups from a single application, is a crucial aspect of modern software architecture. The new multi-tenancy feature in Weaviate is designed to scale to millions of tenants, with the capacity to support over 50,000 active tenants per node. This scalability is complemented by an emphasis on compliance, with features such as GDPR-compliant deletes, and a smooth user experience. If the need arises to onboard more tenants, users can simply add a new node to their existing cluster. This is a significant upgrade from previous versions of Weaviate, which required workarounds to model a multi-tenancy landscape. With the new native multi-tenancy support, Weaviate is rethinking how businesses can scale with their many customers.\n \nMulti-tenancy offers numerous benefits for businesses, particularly in terms of scalability and efficiency. One of the primary advantages is its ease of use; businesses can simply select multi-tenancy for their classes and continue using their favorite features such as super-fast queries, cross-references, and replication. Multi-tenancy also provides cost-efficiency, especially for businesses with usage peaks at certain times but remain inactive for many days of the month. This feature allows for the diversity of tenants, accommodating both large and small customers. Speed is another benefit, as narrowing a request down to a single tenant does not require much work, even with millions of tenants. Onboarding and offboarding are also made easy with multi-tenancy, ensuring that adding or removing a business does not impose a significant computational load. Furthermore, multi-tenancy ensures resource boundaries, preventing the activities of one tenant from interfering with others. In the latest version of Weaviate, multi-tenancy is an opt-in feature, allowing businesses to serve multiple distinct users or user groups from a single application.\n \nWeaviate v1.20, set to be released in July 2023, is introducing a native multi-tenancy feature that can serve multiple distinct users or user groups from a single application. This feature is designed to scale to millions of tenants, with the capacity to support tens of thousands of active tenants per node. In addition to scalability, the new multi-tenancy feature also emphasizes compliance and user experience, offering functionalities such as GDPR-compliant deletes. The multi-tenancy feature is opt-in, so users who don't require it won't be affected. Designed to scale with your business, it can support over 50,000 active tenants per node. If you run out of space but want to onboard more tenants, you can simply add a new node to your existing cluster. The Weaviate team is excited about this upcoming release and welcomes feedback from users.\n \n",
